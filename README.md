# Logic-Minimizer

## version 1.00

Provides a parent class for modules that minimize boolean equations,
such as Algorithm::QuineMcCluskey. You do not need to bother with this
module or even read its documentation unless you need to create a new
minimizer module for use by Logic::TruthTable.
