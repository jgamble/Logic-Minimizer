=head1 NAME

Logic::Minimizer - The parent class of Boolean minimizers.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is the base class for logic minimizers that are used by
L<Logic::TruthTable>. You do not need to use this class (or
indeed read any further) unless you are creating a logic
minimizer package.

    package Algorithm::SomethingNiftyLikeEspresso;
    extends 'Logic::Minimizer';

(C<Algorithm::SomethingNiftyLikeEspresso> has C<Logic::Minimizer>
as its base class, which is required if C<Logic::TruthTable> is to
use it.)

Then, either use the package directly in your program:

    my $fn = Algorithm::SomethingNiftyLikeEspresso->new(
        width => 4,
        minterms => [1, 8, 9, 14, 15],
        dontcares => [2, 3, 11, 12]
    );
    ...

or as a algorithm choice in C<Logic::TruthTable>:

    my $tt = Logic::TruthTable->new(
        width => 4,
        algorithm => 'SomethingNiftyLikeEspresso',
        columns => [
            {
                minterms => [1, 8, 9, 14, 15],
                dontcares => [2, 3, 11, 12],
            }
            {
                minterms => [4, 5, 6, 10, 13],
                dontcares => [2, 3, 11, 12],
            }
        ],
    );

This class provides the attributes and some of the methods for your
minimizer class.

=head2 Attributes

These are the attributes provided by C<Logic::Minimizer> to
create and reduce the object. Some attributes are required
to be set from the program, some are optional, and others are
generated internally.

The attributes required to create the object are:


=head3 'width'

C<width> is absolutely required -- it tells the object how many
variables are used in the Boolean equation.

=head3 'minterms'

=head3 'maxterms'

The set (if using minterms) or unset (if using maxterms) terms in
the Boolean equation. The choice affects the output of the equation:
using minterms results in a sum-of-products form of the equation, while
using maxterms results in a product-of-sums form.

=head3 'dontcares'

The terms that don't affect the output of the equation at all; that
one literally doesn't care about.

=head3 'columnstring'

=head3 'columnlist'

Alternate ways of providing minterms, maxterms, and don't-care terms.
Position 0 in the string or list represents the 0th row of the column,
position 1 represents the next row, and so on. In either case, the
output is in sum-of-product form.

=head2 Using Attributes

Some common sense rules apply. If 'columnstring' or 'columnlist' is
provided, 'minterms', 'maxterms', and 'dontcares' can't be used.

Likewise, 'minterms' and 'maxterms' can not be used together, and
'dontcares' can't be used by itself.

Some attributes are optional, and are used to changed the look
of the output.

=head2 Optional Attributes

=head3 'title'

A name or description of the problem. Useful for tracking
which object one is working with, if there's more than one.

=head3 'dc'

The don't-care character. May be changed for both aesthetic
and inter-program communication purposes. Used in columnstring
or columnlist attributes. Also used in output files by
C<Logic::TruthTable>, and in 'covers' output (see below).
Defaults to the character '-'.

=head3 'vars'

The variable names used to output the Boolean equation. By default,
uses 'A' to 'Z'. The names do not have to be single characters, e.g.:
C<vars => ['a1', 'a0', 'b1', 'b0']>

=head3 'get_format_string'

=head3 'set_format_string'

The sprintf-style strings used to write your variables. Two
formats are needed, one for the normal output of the variable name,
the other for the complemented form of the variable name.

The the default format is ["%s", "$s'"]. If, for example, you wanted
a more LaTeX compatible format, you could write

    set_format_string(["%s", "\\overline $s"]);

=head2 'Lazy' Attributes

The attributes that are set during the minimizing process.

These are all "lazy" attributes, and calculated when asked
for in code or by the user. All are created by builder
functions that the child class needs to provide.

=head3 'primes'

The prime implicants. A hash in the form
C<'implicant' => [covered terms]>.

=head3 'covers'

The covers are the building blocks of the final form
of the solution to the equation, and are used to create
the text form of the equation.

The terms are listed in an array, but as there may be
more than one way to cover the solution, it is an array
of cover arrays.

=head3 'essentials'

The essential prime implicants (for informational purposes
only, algorithms generally don't need it for minimizing).

=head3 'algorithm'

The class of the child object. for example, if the
class used to solve the set of terms is Algorithm::QuineMcCluskey,
then 'algorithm' would be set to 'QuineMcCluskey'.

=head2 Minimizer Methods

These are the methods needed for error checking, or to read from or
write to the attributes.

Some are provided by C<Logic::Minimizer>, while others (the builder
methods of the attributes 'primes', 'covers', and 'essentials') are
merely method definitions, and are expected to be provided by the
child class.

=head3 to_columnstring

Provided by this module. Converts the column into a single string.

=head3 to_columnlist

Provided by this module. Converts the column into an array reference.

=head3 catch_errors

Provided by this module. Finds basic errors such as empty term arrays,
insufficient variables for the width, terms that don't fit within the
table size, and so forth.

=head3 to_boolean

Provided by this module. Converts a set of covers to a boolean equation.

=head3 to_boolean_term

Provided by this module. Converts a cover term into a boolean expression.
Called by C<to_boolean()>.

=head3 generate_primes

=head3 generate_covers

=head3 generate_essentials

The primes, covers, and essentials attributes need methods to create
those attributes. The child module of C<Logic::Minimizer> should provide these.
